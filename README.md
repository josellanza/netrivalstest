# React App test

In this test I had to build a component for price chaning in products with react and typescript. There is a main page which has some components inside as products, details, the formula and the updated prices.
Note that I create a json file for the data, I also created a services folder to pretend that the data comes from a request to the backend. Some of the functions (as for instances the submitbutton) should make a request to the database in order to change some props but as I cant do any request I just store all the data in the reducers.
